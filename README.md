Predictive Maintenance System
===========================

This repository contains a Predictive Maintenance System using Python and XGBoost.

**Overview**
------------

The Predictive Maintenance System is a machine learning-based system that predicts equipment failures before they occur. The system uses historical data from sensors and other sources to train a model that can identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate a potential failure.

**Features**
------------

* Predicts equipment failures using XGBoost algorithm
* Uses historical data from sensors and other sources
* Identifies patterns and anomalies that may indicate a potential failure
* Provides a classification report and confusion matrix for model evaluation

**Requirements**
---------------

* Python 3.8 or higher
* XGBoost library
* Pandas library
* NumPy library
* Matplotlib library
* Seaborn library
* Plotly library

**Usage**
-----

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive-maintenance-system.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script: `python test.py`
4. The script will load the data, preprocess it, and train the XGBoost model.
5. The model will make predictions on the test data and provide a classification report and confusion matrix.

**Data**
-----

The data used in this system is a sample dataset containing historical data from sensors and other sources. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `predictive_maintenance.csv`
